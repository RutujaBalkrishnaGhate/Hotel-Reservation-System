# Hotel-Reservation-System
Spring MVC Architecture


## 1. Introduction:
I propose the development of a Hotel Reservation System, an all-in-one platform that facilitates hotel
booking, room selection, and payment processing. The system aims to provide users with a seamless
experience in finding, reserving, and managing hotel accommodations. It will be developed using the
Spring Boot framework and backed by MySQL for efficient and secure data storage.
## 2. Objectives: The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Develop an Intuitive Hotel Reservation System: Create a user-friendly web application for
hotel bookings and reservations.
2. Effortless Room Browsing and Selection: Allow users to easily browse and search for
available rooms based on various criteria.
3. Secure Payment Gateway: Implement a secure payment gateway to handle online
transactions for room reservations.
4. Intuitive User Interface for Booking and Add-ons: Provide users with an intuitive interface to
select room types, add-ons, and specify booking details.
5. Reservation System and Availability Management: Integrate a reservation system to
efficiently manage bookings, room availability, and schedules.
6. Automated Invoicing and Confirmation: Automate the generation of invoices and
confirmation details for completed reservations.
7. Admin Dashboard for Hotel Management: Develop an administration panel exclusively for
hotel staff to manage room inventory, pricing, user accounts, and reporting.
## 3. Technology Stack:
The proposed technology stack for the Hotel Reservation System includes:
1. Spring Boot: A Java-based framework designed for the development of standalone,
production-grade Spring applications. It emphasizes simplicity and convention over
configuration.
2. Hibernate: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that facilitates the mapping of
Java objects to database tables. It streamlines database interactions in Java applications.
3. DAO Pattern: Implementation of the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern, which separates data
access logic from business logic. This pattern enhances modularity and maintainability in
application design.
4. Annotated Controllers: Utilization of Spring MVC's annotated controllers for organized and
concise handling of HTTP requests. This approach simplifies the creation of RESTful web
services and improves code readability.
5. Annotated POJOs for Hibernate: Use Hibernate's annotated Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)
to define mappings between Java objects and database tables. This simplifies the configuration
and enhances the readability of the code.
6. IoC Pattern: Leveraging the Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern facilitated by Spring's
dependency injection. This pattern promotes loose coupling, making components more modular
and easing the management of dependencies.
## 4. Key Features:
The Hotel Reservation System will include the following key features:
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and securely log in to
access the Hotel Reservation System.
2. Room Listing and Details: Display a comprehensive list of available rooms with details such as
room type, amenities, and pricing.
3. Search and Filter: Enable users to search for rooms based on criteria such as location, date,
price range, and room specifications.
4. Booking Packages: Define various booking packages (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite) with
corresponding rates and terms.
5. Online Reservation: Allow users to select rooms, choose booking packages, specify booking
duration, and make online reservations.
6. Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate a secure payment gateway to process online
transactions using popular payment methods.
7. Reservation Management: Implement a reservation system to track bookings, room
availability, and schedules.
8. Invoicing and Confirmation: Automatically generate invoices and confirmation details for
completed reservations.
9. Admin Dashboard: Provide an administration panel exclusively for hotel staff to manage room
inventory, pricing, user accounts, and reporting.
The Hotel Reservation System aims to enhance the hotel booking experience, offering a user-centric
platform for both customers and hotel administrators.
